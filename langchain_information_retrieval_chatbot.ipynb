The author would \\nappreciate being informed who it is sent to via email.1DEDICATION\\nThis  book  is dedicated  to all my teachers  and  especially  Prof.  K.B.  Kunwar, \\nProfessor and Head, Department of Medicine, King George Medical College (1960\\xad\\n1977), Lucknow who as a medical philosopher par excellence and a teacher to the \\ncore  laid in me the seeds of this book.\\nIt is dedicated to My Family who kept egging me on to complete this book.\\nAs happens with a \\x00irst book, and one with a new approach,  it gets  modi\\x00ied on each \\nreading and with progressive teaching of its contents to successive generations of \\nmedical  students. \\nOver the years this book has been in a continuous stat e of revision and so is also \\ndedicated to My Students.\\nAnd perhaps continue to be improved upon.CLINICAL MEDICINE\\nA SYSTEM OF DIA GNOSIS \\nINTR ODUCTION\\nClinical medicine encompasses two important facets:\\n\\uf09fReaching a complet e diagnosis, and\\n\\uf09fGetting the patient to compl y with the management strategy planned \\nOne being skill and the other an art, both of these have to take into account practicalities, and have to be \\ncost-eﬀecti ve and within available resour ces. A good complet e diagnosis reduces investig ation costs and \\navoidance of polypharmacy further reduces the costs incurr ed.\\nThis short work deals with a unif orm format for diagnostic workup of a patient presenting with any \\nsympt om or sign due to involvement of any system.  An obvious and useful bias will be ther e towards the \\ncommon diseases and presentations but the format is adaptable to all branches, disciplines and specialties.\\nDIA GNOSIS includes-  \\n\\uf09fSite of Disease (Anat omical)\\n\\uf09fNatur e of Disease (Etiological)\\n\\uf09fPathoph ysiology (Complications)\\n\\uf09fFunctional Distur bance (Dysfunction)\\nBook s on clinical medicine tell us how to elicit the history and physical signs whereas standar d text book s \\ndiscuss diseases one by one but ther e is no good book linking the former with the  latter and this present \\nwork does just that .\\n \\nThis short treatise aims to train the clinician to reach a diagnosis by a rational step-b y-step anal ysis of \\ndata obtained by the history and physical examination of patient , supplement ed by some well reasoned \\ninvestig ations. Then one can read about the disease at length from any standar d text book.\\nThe art and science of clinical medicine does not under go much change with time. Thoug h new er tests, \\ndrugs and even diseases are disco vered, basic clinical appr oach remains the same and is applicable to all \\nbranches, disciplines and specialties of medicine- it is all encompassing.\\nA good rapport with the patient is essential while taking history of illness and examining him. Well \\ndirected tests are also needed in man y cases.  \\n2DIAGNOSIS can be made in man y ways and one w ay ma y be mor e suit ed than the other in an \\nindividual case. Bef ore we go t o the C OMMON PLAN a w ord about these v arious diagnostic methods is in \\norder.\\nWAYS IN WHICH A DIA GNOSIS CAN BE MADE\\n1.

In vestig ations: \\n· Routine\\n· Random\\n· Speci\\x00ic\\n· Screening Pr ogrammes\\nThe ne xt section starts with a Common Plan about compiling the data fr om the v arious parts of the \\nHist ory, Gener al Ex amination, S ystemic Ex amination and the Other S ystems and ho w to anal yze this data \\nin small compr ehensi ve and compr ehensible segments.\\nThe sections f ollowing tak e up this Common Plan as applied t o the v arious s ystems of the bod y; \\nCardiology , Respir atory S ystem, Neur ology , Liver and Kidne y diseases. Each of these s ystems has its o wn \\npeculiar anat omic con\\x00igur ation and sub-sit es, common types of diseases and also their o wn \\npathoph ysiology .\\n \\nTher eafter, ther e is a v ery short section w hich summat es the inf ormation this book pr ovides and \\n\\x00inall y an epilogue w hich seek s to put things int o a pr actical perspecti ve and r e-emphasizes the \\nimportance of a w holesome diagnosis and ho w ther apy is gear ed to this kno wledge.Diagnosis \\nfor the \\nDoct or\\nPrognosis \\nfor the \\nRelati vesRelief \\nfor the \\nPatient\\n3The complet e diagnosis including all four parts mentioned earlier can be decipher ed by asking a set \\nseries of questions after having elicit ed the history and physical signs.\\n(Not e:   Pathoph ysiology is based on our understanding of how a disease aﬀects a particular organ to \\nproduce dysfunction. It depends on our PREVIOUS knowledge and studies of Physiology and Pathology of \\nsimilar patients.  Some tests can help us in proving the pathoph ysiology oper ating in a particular case.)\\nA.   HISTORY\\nA carefull y elicit ed history should be able to answer the following FIVE questions— A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5\\nA.1     Which ORGAN SYSTEM  is involved? \\nThis is based on the cong lomer ation of sympt oms--car dinal sympt oms of a particular system.\\nIs ther e any particular SITE involved?  \\nThis is suggest ed by some pathognomic sympt oms and other details.  \\n          \\ne.g. -- Lateral chest pain associat ed with dry coug h, and the pain incr easing on coug hing and deep breathing \\nsuggests pleur al pain.\\nA.2  What PATHOPHY SIOL OGY accounts for some of the consequential sympt oms?\\nThese sympt oms explain the changes occurring after the disease progresses.\\nE.g. A patient of known heart disease when develops pedal edema, one can suspect that congesti ve heart \\nfailur e has occurr ed.\\nA.3 CAUSE OF DISE ASE\\n     What is the possible/pr obable Natur e (Etiology)  of the disease?\\n     This is based on --\\nONSE T    --  sudden / acut e / sub-acut e/ insidious\\n     \\nCOUR SE   --  Progressive (slow/r apid)\\n                    --  Regressive\\n                    --  Stationary\\n                    --  EpisodicTHE C OMMON PLAN –\\nAN OUTLINE\\nANALYSIS OF P ATIENT\\'S HIS TORY / PHY SICAL EXAMIN ATION\\n4DURA TION   --  hours, days, weeks, months, years\\nTRE ATMENT  taken and its response\\nNOTE: The natur al history of any disease falls into one of the four patt erns which have to be recognized and \\neach of these patt erns has one or mor e etiologies each (rarely mor e).\\nPattern ONE: \\nThe diseases in this have a SUDDEN ONSET  (all sympt oms occurring within a few hours) and this \\npatt ern has only two causes: - \\nTrauma and Vascular disease.\\nPattern TWO: \\nThese are diseases of ACUTE ONSET  (all primary sympt oms occurring within one or two days) and \\nhaving a PROGRESSIVE COUR SE. They are often self limiting or show a good response to treatment . This \\npatt ern is seen in: - \\nAcute Infections\\nPattern THREE: \\nThis patt ern is char acterized by a SUB- ACUTE ONSET . All primary sympt oms develop within a week \\nor so and have a PROGRESSIVE COUR SE with duration of usuall y less than six months at diagnosis. This \\npatt ern is seen in: -                                                          \\n              Chronic Infections and Malignancies\\nPattern FOUR: \\nThese diseases have an INSIDIOUS ONSET  (All primary sympt oms occur over a time period of mor e \\nthan two/thr ee weeks) and a LONG DURA TION  (often mor e than six months). This is found in: -  \\nChronic diseases often Hereditary/ Genetic/ Metabolic/ Degener ative in Natur e \\n             \\nA subtype of this patt ern is one with an EPISODIC COUR SE and then the etiology is an Electrical \\ndysrhythmia (in the Heart or Brain) as in Epileps y, Cardiac arrhythmias, Autoimmune as a recurr ent \\nautoimmune phenomenon and Reticuloendothelial diseases. Mechanical problems like calculi are also \\nrecurr ent.\\nIt must be stressed that this patt ern recognition needs to take an overview of the Onset , Course, \\nDuration and Response to Treatment and any one of these four is not paramount .\\nA.4   BACKGROUND HISTORY\\n     \\nRelates to the etiology of disease\\n5This includes:  -- Past history\\n                            -- Famil y history\\n                            -- Personal history (this can be gone into as great details as needed)\\n        Included in this heading are habits, occupational, obst etric, sexual and socio-economic histories. \\nA.5  PATHOPHY SIOL OGICAL ABNORMALITY AND DYSFUNCTION MEASUREMENT\\nWhat is the loss of normal working of the patient?\\nThis must be assessed in relation to: \\n                \\n   --  Dail y activities\\n  --  Occupational needs\\n  --  Recreational requir ements\\nDoes the patient have any of the known pathoph ysiological  syndr ome of the system?\\n    \\nNOTE:   Assessment of points A.4. (Back ground history) and A.5. (Dysfunction) also helps in deciding the \\nmodes of ther apy, how much the patient needs to be told about his illness and in establishing rapport . \\nB.   GENERAL EXAMIN ATION\\n      A carefull y directed gener al examination should be aimed at providing the answer to  the following \\nTHREE questions: B1, B2 and B3\\nB.1 VITAL SIGNS AND ANY OBVIOUS ABNORMALITIES\\nThis would include  --  Pulse\\n                                 --  Blood Pressur e\\n                                 --  Respir ation\\n                                 --  Consciousness\\n                                 --  Any other striking featur es, including facies\\nNOTE:  Abnormalities of Vital Signs signify advanced disease. This may be due to a Primary disease in \\nany system but is related pathoph ysiologicall y to the Heart , Lungs or Nerv ous System which are \\naﬀect ed curr ently.\\nB.2 ETIOL OGICAL CONFIRMA TION\\n      Is ther e any \\x00inding which corr obor ates the etiology? e.g,\\n -\\x00inding hard \\x00ixed lymph glands in a case of malignancy , or  \\n -symmetrical, large joint swellings in Rheumatic heart disease, or \\n -Caf e-au-lait spots in spinal cord compr ession\\n6B.3 PATHOPHY SIOL OGICAL DISTURB ANCE  PRESENT  AND MEASUREMENT OF DYSFUNCTION\\nWhat is the result of objecti ve assessment of dysfunction?\\nAre ther e any speci\\x00ic pathoph ysiologic syndr omes of the involved system (e.g., Respir atory failur e in \\nchronic bronchitis, or Congesti ve Cardiac Failur e in mitr al stenosis) present?\\nC.   SYSTEMIC EXAMIN ATION\\nOf systems other than the one primaril y aﬀect ed.\\nThis should tell us:\\nC.1  Has the same disease aﬀect ed other systems earlier and then caused the present problem? \\nE.g. In Congenital heart disease, ther e may be other congenital anomalies, or \\nPulmonary tuber culosis may precede the involvement of kidne ys by the mycobact eria.                 \\nC.2  Whether  other  systems are aﬀect ed by  the  disease, such as,           \\nPolycythemia in Chronic Lung Diseases, or Thrombo-embolic episode in  Mitr al  Stenosis with atrial \\n\\x00ibrillation, or Gastric hemorr hage in cerebro-vascular stroke.\\nD. SYSTEMIC EXAMIN ATION OF THE AFFE CTED SYSTEM\\nThis should provide the answer to the following two questions, D1 and D2.\\nD.1   Which site and sub-sit e is/ar e involved?\\n       Each system has diﬀer ent sites and sub-sit es which can be involved in any disease process and these will \\nbe enumer ated with each system.\\nD.2 Can the site, sub-sit e involved or the permutations and combinations of the aforementioned tell us the \\npossible disease responsible?\\n E.g, Anterior horn cell is only aﬀect ed by Polio and Mot or Neur one Disease whereas pure mot or spastic \\nparaplegia has only a few well known causes.\\nE.    INVES TIGATIONS\\n       These should be able to answer the following queries. E1, E2, E3 and E4.\\nE.1  What  SITE/SUB- SITE is aﬀect ed?\\nE.2  What is the CAUSE (NATURE) of this process?\\nE.3  Presence and measur ement of any PATHOPHY SIOL OGICAL SYNDR OMES  such as measuring CVP in a \\ndoubtful CHF , Pulmonary Wedge pressur e in left heart disease.\\n7E.4   What is the FUNCTION AL DISABILITY  produced? Can we quantify this disability and decipher its \\npatt ern? E.g. Spir ometry in COPD\\nNOTE:  The investig ations should be mainl y directed   towards delineation of Site, Natur e, measur ement of \\npathoph ysiological alteration and quanti\\x00ication of dysfunction. \\nSome of these 4 points may become clear from a thor ough clinical   examination and only need   \\ncon\\x00irmation by investig ations, whereas the rest may need to be investig ated as they could not be \\ndetermined by Clinical Anal ysis.

EXAMIN ATION OF NER VOUS SYSTEM\\nThis aims to \\x00ind site, sub-sit e and sub-sub sites of lesions. Also primary and secondary sites, e.g. \\nMitr al stenosis with Atrial \\x00ibrillation leading to embolism and syndr ome of Middle Cerebral Arterial \\nOcclusion. \\nPhysical examination only indir ectly reveals site as what we examine is dysfunction in a highly \\nspecialized organ and dysfunction is unlik ely to pinpoint the site aﬀect ed. (The actual change in respir atory \\nsystem, for example, a consolidat ed lung can be diagnosed by physical examination but except for the \\nperipher al nerv es and retina, rest of the centr al nerv ous system is enclosed in membr ano-\\x00ibr o-bone y \\nchamber and cannot be directly examined.)\\nThe stud y of dysfunction which is the only method for assessing site of disease is divided into the \\nhigher functions and spinal functions.\\nIn examination of those functions which do not depend upon the integrity of a sing le modality  alone \\nlike gait, speech, consciousness, localization is less precise; but if found normal does rule out signi\\x00icant \\ndisease of most of the nerv ous system. \\nCranial nerv e involvement is mor e speci\\x00ic but supr anuclear VII, XII & III, IV & VI can be aﬀect ed through \\nindir ect mechanisms and does not necessaril y indicat e the brain stem as the site of disease.\\n \\n\\uf0a7 Spinal functions including: \\n\\uf076UMN            \\n\\uf09fPyramidal\\n\\uf09fExtr apyramidal\\n\\uf076LMN           \\n\\uf09fAnterior Horn Cell \\n\\uf09fNerv e\\n\\uf076Sensory        \\n\\uf09fLateral column\\n\\uf09fPosterior column\\n\\uf09fCerebellar     \\n\\uf09fAutonomic Nerv ous System\\nThese modalities can be aﬀect ed \"Verticall y\" from cerebral cort ex down to the lowest spinal segment \\nand then along the peripher al nerv e up to the myoneur al junction. In this regard, localization of the vertical \\nsite is most de\\x00init e if ther e is involvement of LMN > UMN > Sensory .   \\nExtr apyramidal and cerebellar involvement is less helpful in localization of site. Absence of a sing le deep \\ntendon re\\x00lex and wasting are really important LMN signs. Similar ly, the association of a segmental or nerv e \\ndistribution of sensory involvement is very helpful. UMN de\\x00icit has an indet erminat e patt ern. From T-1—L-\\n1, sensory involvement may not mat ch the site. They may also be aﬀect ed horizontall y (as in transe verse \\nmyelitis man y modalities may be aﬀect ed).  \\n28D.1 SITE LOCALIS ATION\\nA. What higher functions are involved?

This incorpor ates Natur e, Site, Pathoph ysiology and Dysfunction. This knowledge is \\nessential to attempt to treat the patient fully and correctly. Obviously knowledge has its \\nshort comings and all these parts of the complet e diagnosis are not known for all human diseases. In \\nan individual patient , all these parts may not be known.\\n In the clinical setting, the work up of a patient starts with the sympt om anal ysis and the First \\nTier  of treatment is based on attempting to relieve the sympt oms . This of course is the time honor ed \\nway and man y systems of medicine (other than allopathic) are still in this phase of their treatment \\nappr oach. The scienti\\x00ic base of ther apy in most systems of Medicine is limit ed to observ ation. \\n The \\x00irst tier ther apy is very useful, universall y applicable and by itself enoug h if the disease is \\nself limiting and does not leave any structur al damage (Anat omical abnormality).\\n The Second Tier of therapy is also aimed at relieving symptoms but based on the \\npathoph ysiologic al concepts  so that edema is not just treated by diur etics but classi\\x00ied into Renal, \\nCardiac or Hepatic edema and the appr opriat e ther apy is  planned which may be spir onolact one \\n(and/or I.V. albumin) for Hepatic Edema; for Congesti ve Cardiac Failur e diur etics, digo xin and \\nenalapril may be used. These measur es aimed at count eracting the pathoph ysiology do not, \\nhowever, treat the natur e of disease or the structur al anomalies resulting from it. In cases where the \\ndisease is self limiting and no residual structur al damage exists, this second tier of ther apy is enoug h. \\nThis is the case in most viral infections, most trauma, some bact erial and other infections. \\n \\n The allopathic system of medicine is well advanced in the understanding of pathoph ysiology . \\nIn fact, new er understandings have opened way for new er modalities of ther apy. The disco very of \\nNitric Oxide and other gases which are found to have their eﬀect , and are metabolized within \\nseconds have opened new vistas for new er pathoph ysiological appr oaches to treatment .\\n However, this second tier of ther apy is often of limit ed clinical use because man y such \\nprocesses are present in various sites and organs and treatment is usuall y not site/or gan speci\\x00ic \\nand side eﬀects  in other organs can be a problem, for example when  beta block ers  are used in heart \\ndisease they may cause bronchoconstriction in the lungs.\\n The Thir d Tier  of ther apy is based on corr ecting macr oscopic structur al chang es. This is the \\nsurgeon \\'s forte and is especiall y useful if the etiology is curable, \\n46contr ollable or self limiting as in oper ation for post traumatic strictur e of urethr a; Mitr al valve \\nsurgery and contr olling the relapses of Rheumatic Fever or surgical corr ection of congenital cardiac \\nstructur al defects (the cause having occurr ed during antenatal or natal period and ther efore does \\nnot recur).\\n The futur e holds promise for corr ecting micr oscopic structur al defects by using the oper ating \\nmicr oscope and even structur al genetic defects by engineering.\\n However, this 3rd tier of ther apy is not enoug h if the disease is not self limiting and non \\ncontr ollable. The classical example is Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery where narr owed arteries are \\nbypassed by surgery but the process of Ather oscler osis which leads to the narr owing is not \\nreversible and fresh narr owing keeps on occurring.\\n The Fourt h Tier  of ther apy is the most dif\\x00icult as it deals with curing/ contr olling the etiolog y \\nof disease. Man y-a-times we diagnose this part of the disease process after the damage has already \\nbeen done. Often the etiology is not known and sometimes its treatment modality is not known. The \\nsaving grace is that persist ent structur al damage and the mild pathoph ysiological changes are \\nreversible with treatment or are self limiting.  The contr ol of disease at its outset (bef ore irreversible \\nstructur al or pathoph ysiological changes have occurr ed) requir es determination, political will and \\nthe economic means, even when known.\\n Treatment at this tier is complicat ed for an individual who has a disease etiology which does \\nnot cause harm i.e. he is a carrier , treatment is not needed especiall y if ther e are no toxic eﬀects, \\nhowever, from the public health view point treatment of carriers helps in contr olling spread. The \\nlogistics depends upon the ratio of clinical disease to inappar ent infection and carrier rates to \\nanal yze the cost-bene\\x00it ratio for each individual disease, and also assessment of the logistics is \\nrequir ed to mak e such ventur es probable.\\n Few examples are in order, that overpopulation as a cause of man y medical diseases is well \\nknown but the eﬀorts to contr ol it so far have not succeeded. Smoking is a hazar d but the lack of \\npolitical will and socio-economic conditions have hamper ed its contr ol and that of the man y known \\ndiseases arising from its use.  The prevention of malaria is another example which succeeded \\ninitiall y and failed subsequentl y.\\n In this way rational ther apy can only be done when a bett er ther apeutic appr oach is done \\nbased on the total diagnosis of the patient as outlined in the preceding sections of this book.\\n47SUMMARY OF C.V .
